# The Clean Coder by Robert C. Martin
## Chapter 1: Professionalism
* Be careful what you ask for
* Non professionals don't have to take responsibility for their job. When a professional makes a mistake, he owns it
* Product is more important than your ego
* Be responsible for your imperfections
* Assume the code is faulty until you check it
* Every time QA finds a problem, be determined to prevent it from happening again
* To know the code works, test it. Then, test it again. And again.
* The code is hard to test if it's been designed to be hard to test
* "If you want your code to be flexible, you have to flex it"
* Merciless refactoring: always make some random acts of kindness to the code whenever you see it
* How do you prove you are not afraid to change the code? You change it all the time.
* It's your responsibility to develop yourself
** Plan on working 60h/week: 40h for employer, 20h for you. Do the 20h with passion, it should be fun
* Know your domain: discover the abundant wealth of ideas available at the tip of your fingertips. 
* Learn things that are outside of your comfort zone
* The best way to learn is to teach
** Design patterns
** Design principles
** Working Methods: Scrum, Kanban, XP, Structured Analysis, Structured Design
** Disciplines: TDD, Object Oriented Design, Structured Programming, Continous Integration, Pair Programming
** Artifacts: 
*** UML
*** DFD
*** Structure Chart
*** Petri Nets
*** Transition Diagrams
*** Flow charts
*** Decision tables
* Identify with your employer - their problems are *your* problems. Understand them and work to develop the solution
* "Programming is an act of supreme arrogance"
## Chapter 2: Saying No
* "Do; or do not. There is no trying." - Yoda
** When you say you'll try, you're telling you'll use some unused reservoir of energy you've been holding back
* Stop being afraid of confrontation
* Facts > why. 
* The higher the stakes, the more important No becomes
* A team player communicates frequently, keeps an eye for his teammates and does his responsibilities the best he can
* Mind the cost of saying yes. Sometimes the only way to get to the right Yes is to be unafraid to say No
* Don't try to be a hero
## Chapter 3: Saying Yes
* You're not obliged to say Yes to everything, but it's good to work to find ways to make Yes possible
### A Language of Commitment
* Say. Mean. Do. 
** Lack of commitment: Need/Should; Hope/wish; Let's
* You can only commit to things you have full control of
* As a professional you're obliged to write code that passes certain standards. Do not cut corners
